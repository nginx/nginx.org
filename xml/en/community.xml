Open source powers much of the technology world.
NGINX has been a strong part of this movement from its inception.
As the internet has grown, so have we, from our initial web server to the
myriad of projects involving JavaScript, Kubernetes, API gateways,
OpenTelemetry, and WebAssembly.
NGINX is committed to open source both in ethos and practicality, aiming to
deliver reliable and cutting-edge technology
within a healthy open source culture.
Whether NGINX is part of your open source past or a step in your present,
we welcome you into the future together.
