<para>
njs does not evaluate dynamic code,
especially code received from the network, in any way.
The only way to evaluate that code using njs
is to configure the
<link doc="../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml" id="js_import">js_import</link>
directive in nginx.
JavaScript code is loaded once during nginx start.
</para>

<para>
In the nginx/njs threat model, JavaScript code is considered a trusted source
in the same way as <literal>nginx.conf</literal> and sites certificates.
What this means in practice:

<list type="bullet">

<listitem>
memory disclosure and other security issues
triggered by JavaScript code modification
are not considered security vulnerabilities, but rather ordinary bugs
</listitem>

<listitem>
measures should be taken for protecting JavaScript code used by njs
</listitem>

<listitem>
if no <link doc="../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml" id="js_import">js_import</link>
directives are present in <literal>nginx.conf</literal>,
nginx is safe from JavaScript-related vulnerabilities
</listitem>

</list>
