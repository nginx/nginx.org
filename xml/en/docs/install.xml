<section id="freebsd" name="Installation on FreeBSD">

<para>
On FreeBSD, nginx can be installed either from the <link
url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/packages-using.html">packages</link>
or through the
<link url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">ports</link>
system.
The ports system provides greater flexibility, allowing selection among
a wide range of options.
The port will compile nginx with the specified options and install it.

<section id="source_install" name="Building from Sources">

<para>
If some special functionality is required, not available with packages and
ports, nginx can also be compiled from source files.
While more flexible, this approach may be complex for a beginner.
For more information, see <link doc="configure.xml"/>.
